Problem Definition – AI for Maize and Tomato Disease Detection in Kenya
Background

Agriculture is the backbone of Kenya’s economy, and maize and tomato are two of the most important crops for food security and income. However, smallholder farmers face huge yield losses every year due to crop diseases. Many rely on delayed or inaccurate diagnosis, since access to agricultural extension officers and experts is limited. By the time symptoms are visible and understood, significant damage has already occurred.

Problem

Farmers lack timely, affordable, and accurate tools to detect and identify diseases in maize and tomato plants. Traditional methods require expertise, lab tests, or expert extension officers, which are often unavailable in rural areas. As a result, farmers frequently misdiagnose problems, apply the wrong pesticides, or fail to act early — leading to financial losses, food insecurity, and increased vulnerability.

Objective

The goal of this project is to build an AI-powered crop disease detection tool that can classify common diseases in maize and tomato plants directly from leaf images. The tool will:

Accept a photo of a maize or tomato leaf as input.

Identify whether the leaf is healthy or diseased.

If diseased, classify it into the specific disease type.

Provide confidence levels in predictions.

Scope

Crops covered: Maize and Tomato.

Diseases covered:

Maize: Common Rust, Northern Leaf Blight, Healthy.

Tomato: Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Mold, Healthy.

Tech stack (planned): Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, Streamlit/FastAPI for deployment.

Data sources: PlantVillage dataset + supplementary image datasets (public agricultural repositories).

Users: Smallholder farmers, agricultural extension officers, NGOs.

Impact

An effective AI tool for maize and tomato disease detection could:

Improve early detection and response to crop diseases.

Reduce crop losses and improve food security.

Lower pesticide misuse and costs.

Empower smallholder farmers with accessible technology.

Future Vision

Expand to additional crops and diseases.

Deploy as a mobile app accessible in rural Kenya.

Integrate SMS/USSD-based advisory for farmers without smartphones.

Collaborate with agricultural agencies to scale nationwide.
