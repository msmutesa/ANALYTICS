## 🌍 Project Overview
**ShambaAI** is an AI-powered tool designed to help Kenyan farmers quickly identify **diseases in maize and tomato plants** 🌽🍅.  
By using computer vision and deep learning, the model can detect whether a leaf is healthy or affected by common diseases, giving farmers faster insights for better decisions.  

## ✨ Why This Matters
- 🚜 Agriculture is Kenya’s backbone, but crop diseases cause massive losses.  
- 🧑🏽‍🌾 Many smallholder farmers lack access to expert diagnosis.  
- 🤖 AI can empower farmers with **fast, affordable, and accurate tools**.  

## 🧪 Scope
- **Crops:** Maize 🌽, Tomato 🍅  
- **Diseases covered:**  
  - *Maize:* Common Rust, Northern Leaf Blight, Healthy  
  - *Tomato:* Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Mold, Healthy  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas  
- **Deployment:** Streamlit / FastAPI
